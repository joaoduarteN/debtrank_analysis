# debtrank_analysis
This project analyzes systemic risk propagation in financial networks using complex network theory, focusing on the DebtRank algorithm to measure risk spread across various topologies. The study investigates how shocks affect nodes within four network models - scale-free, small-world, random, and spatial (Waxman) - each representing different structural characteristics. By simulating node failures, we assess how network topology influences resilience or susceptibility to systemic shocks. Results indicate that topological features, such as eigenvector centrality, can significantly affect systemic risk, depending on the interconnectedness of the network. Topologies with centralized nodes, such as scale-free networks, heighten vulnerability, while clustered structures, like small-world networks, contain localized risks. The study contributes to systemic risk analysis by clarifying how network structure affects financial stability, providing insights relevant to risk management.
